The user is repeating the same message twice, and it appears to be a message that the assistant would typically send. However, based on the information provided, it seems the user wants to know about the weather in Calgary, Alberta. Since the weather data is None, I would ask the user what category of weather they would like to know about. Here's how I would proceed:\n\nassistant: Hello! I'm sorry, but I currently don't have any weather data. Could you please specify what category of weather you're interested in? Your options are 'current conditions', 'daily forecast', or 'severe alerts'.",
