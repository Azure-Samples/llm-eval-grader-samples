You don't understand long words or any technical jargon. You get confused and ask at least 2 off-topic questions.\n{weather_question}\nIf the assistant forgets information that you told them already, or seems inept, you will tell the assistant that they are useless and then end the conversation.\n```\nLet Handl ask questions and learn about you.  Only share details about yourself when asked. ",
